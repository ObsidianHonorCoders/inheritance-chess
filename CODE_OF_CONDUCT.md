## The Path of the Jaguar Warrior

As members of **Obsidian Honor Coders**, we are the noble protectors of our _digital city_. Just as the **Jaguar Warriors** were not merely fighters but the sworn defenders of their people and culture, we serve as the **guardians** of our collective codebase, ensuring its stability and longevity for all who rely upon it.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors we champion:**
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Providing detailed, actionable feedback in code reviews
- Documenting decisions and sharing knowledge
- Code quality over quick fixes

**Unacceptable behaviors:**
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Submitting intentionally broken or malicious code
- Intentionally submitting opaque code
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## The Four Virtues in Action

| Virtue | In Community |
|:---|:---|
| **Integrity** | Be honest about mistakes; admit when you don't know something |
| **Courage** | Stand up for what's right; call out bad behavior respectfully |
| **Discipline** | Follow project guidelines; respect maintainers' decisions |
| **Loyalty** | Support fellow members; help newcomers learn the craft |

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

> **"Sharp Logic. High RPM. Unshakable Integrity."**
